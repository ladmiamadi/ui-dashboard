This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What to do first
- You should create a `env.js` file in the `/public` folder. You can duplicate & rename the existing `env.example.js` file
- Configure the environment variables in that file to fit your needs
- Run `yarn start` & enjoy!
